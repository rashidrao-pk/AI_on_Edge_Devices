## Roadmap

### Current Phase

- [ ] **Phase 1: Initial Setup**
  - [x] Collect initial set of images for CIFAR-10 categories.
  - [x] Organize images by category and type.
  - [x] Implement image preprocessing pipeline.
  
### Upcoming Phases

- [ ] **Phase 2: Model Testing**
  - [ ] Integrate alternative images into the CIFAR-10 inference pipeline.
  - [ ] Benchmark model performance on alternative images.
  - [ ] Create visualization tools for inference results.

- [ ] **Phase 3: Enhancement and Expansion**
  - [ ] Collect more challenging images to increase dataset size.
  - [ ] Add synthetic and cartoon-styled images for additional variety.
  - [ ] Implement more advanced data augmentation techniques.

### Future Goals

- [ ] Build an end-to-end automated pipeline for inference testing.
- [ ] Inference on other edge devices.
- [ ] Publish the dataset and pipeline for community use.
