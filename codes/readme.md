# **AI-on-Edge-Devices: AI Model Deployment on Raspberry Pi**


## **Models ðŸ’»:**
Models trained and optimized for edge deployment are available in this [repository](https://github.com/yasir). They include:
- `VGG16`, `ResNet50`, `Custom CNN` models

## **Model Training:**
To train a model from scratch:
 - Run the notebook **`N1_EDGE_AI_TRAIN.ipynb`** [here](codes/N1_EDGE_AI_TRAIN.ipynb).
---

## **Run Inference:**
To perform inference on trained models, use the following notebooks and scripts:

1. **Local Machine Inference:** Use integrated or mobile cameras to test model inference.
   - **Run Script for CIFAR-10:**
     ```bash
     python run_inference.py --dataset cifar10 --brightness 70
     ```
   - **Run Script for MNIST:**
     ```bash
     python run_inference.py --dataset mnist --brightness 70
     ```
